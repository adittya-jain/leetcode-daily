# Daily DSA Practice on LeetCode

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey of practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) daily on LeetCode. This repository is a collection of my solutions to the daily problems posted on LeetCode, along with explanations and insights I gain along the way.

## About

I believe that consistency is key to mastering any skill, especially in the field of software development. To sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of DSA, I have committed to solving at least one problem on LeetCode every day. This repository serves as a log of my progress and a resource for anyone interested in learning and improving their own skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by date, with each folder containing the following:

- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem, including the constraints and examples.
- **Solution**: My code solution to the problem, written in Java (or any other language I may choose to practice with).
- **Explanation**: An explanation of my approach, the algorithm used, and any important insights or edge cases considered.

## Example

Here is an example structure for a daily problem:

```
/
└── com.monthYEAR
    ├── Solution.java as monthDD.java
```


### Solution.java

Contains my solution to the problem in Java.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Date**: Navigate through the folders organized by date to find problems solved on specific days.
2. **Search by Topic**: Use the repository search to find problems related to specific DSA topics (e.g., arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming).
3. **Learn and Practice**: Review the problems and solutions to understand different approaches and techniques. Use the explanations to gain deeper insights.
